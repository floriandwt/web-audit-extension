## How to use it?

### 1. Install the Extension
If the Extension gets approved you will find it in the Raycast Store.
You can install the extension via the `import extension` command directly in Raycast.

### 2. Use the command
The command for starting the Extension is `Analyze Website [https://raycast.com/]`. You can use any URL you want, if it is not reachable or you don't type the URL in including a protocol, the extension will throw an error.

After a few seconds you should see your results and some information about the website on the right side.
